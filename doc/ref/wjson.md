### jsoncons::wjson

```c++
#include <jsoncons/json.hpp>

typedef basic_json<wchar_t,
                   ImplementationPolicy = sorted_policy,
                   Allocator = std::allocator<wchar_t>> wjson
```

The `wjson` class is an instantiation of the [basic_json](basic_json.md) class template that uses `wchar_t` as the character type. The order of an object's name/value pairs is not preserved, they are sorted alphabetically by name. If you want to preserve the original insertion order, use [wojson](wojson.md) instead.
